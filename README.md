# openHAB Synology DiskStation Package

A Synology DiskStation Package for [openHAB](http://www.openhab.org/) exploiting the latest features from Synology DSM 6.0 and onwards. That also means **no** support for Synology DSM versions below 6.0.

**What you can expect:**

* An installation wizard that let you configure the HTTP and HTTPS ports for openHAB
* A shared folder named *openhab* for all user editable configurations files
* Integration within *Hyper Backup* like native Synology packages
* Usage of [privilege specification](https://developer.synology.com/developer-guide/privilege/privilege_specification.html) to reduce security risks
* Certificate mangement through Synyology DSM. You can create your own certificate from within Synology DSM or get a free Let's Encrypt certificate. No need to manually fiddle around with certificates. Only a few clicks and [openHAB](http://www.openhab.org/) is secured by a trusted and free Let's Encrypt certificate!
* Log rotation managed under the hood by Synology DSM
* An openHAB application integrated in Synology DSM to change the HTTP and HTTPS ports later on
